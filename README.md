Yatai makes it easy to deploy and operate machine learning serving workload at scale on Kubernetes.
Yatai is built upon [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml), the unified model serving framework.

Core features:

* **Bento Registry** - manage all your team's Bentos and Models, backed by cloud blob storage(S3, MinIO)
* **Deployment Automation** - deploy Bentos as auto-scaling API endpoints on Kubernetes and easily rollout new versions
* **Observability** - monitoring dashboard helping users to identify model performance issues
* **CI/CD** - flexible APIs for integrating with your training and CI pipelines


## Why Yatai

* Yatai is built upon [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML), the unified model serving framework that is high-performing and feature-rich
* Yatai focus on the model serving and deployment part of your MLOps stack, works well with any ML training/monitoring platforms, such as AWS SageMaker or MLFlow
* Yatai is Kubernetes native, integrates well with other cloud native tools in the K8s eco-system
* Yatai is human-centric, provides easy-to-use Web UI and APIs for ML scientists, MLOps engineers, and project managers


## Getting Started

1. Create an ML Service with BentoML following the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/quickstart.html) or sample projects in the [BentoML Gallery](https://github.com/bentoml/gallery).

2. Install Yatai locally with Minikube.
   * Prerequisites:
     * Install latest minikube: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
     * Install latest Helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
   * Start a minikube Kubernetes cluster: `minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096`
   * Install Yatai Helm Chart:
     ```bash
     helm repo add yatai https://bentoml.github.io/yatai-chart
     helm repo update
     helm install yatai yatai/yatai -n yatai-system --create-namespace
     ```
   * Wait for installation to complete: `helm status yatai -n yatai-system`
   * Start minikube tunnel for accessing Yatai UI: `minikube tunnel`
   * Open browser at http://yatai.127.0.0.1.sslip.io and login with default account `admin:admin`

3. See [Administrator's Guide](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai/blob/main/docs/admin-guide.md) for a comprehensive overview for deploying and configuring Yatai for production use.
