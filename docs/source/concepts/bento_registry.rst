Bento Registry
==============

The bento registry is a hub for storing, versioning, and sharing :doc:`bento` for collaboration. The relationship between :code:`Bento registry` and :code:`Bentos` is analogous to :code:`Docker registry` and :code:`Docker images`.

yatai-deployment relies on bento registry because it is responsible for deploying Bento from bento registry to kubernetes.
